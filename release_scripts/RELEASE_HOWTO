Amarok Release process
----------------------

SECTION -1: Before you even start
 * Review https://community.kde.org/ReleasingSoftware , https://invent.kde.org/sdk/releaseme
   or other up-to-date KDE release instructions and compare with this HOWTO to find out if
   this document contains outdated information. Update this document where appropriate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
- The Ultimate KDE Extragear Release Script from https://invent.kde.org/sdk/releaseme

SECTION 0: Some weeks in advance

 * Check that release date doesn't clash with KDE's schedule, https://community.kde.org/Schedules
 * Notify translators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1: Preparation

 * Check the README file is still relevant
 * Run the "fixuifiles" script from kde-dev-scripts from the repository root
 * Run the "bump_plugin_version.rb" script from the repository root
 * Set AMAROK_VERSION to the release version at shared/Version.h
 * Verify that ChangeLog is up to date and latest version number corresponds to current one
 * Add new version to <releases> in src/org.kde.amarok.appdata.xml
 * Commit the source to git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2: Creating and Testing the Tarball

 * Run the releaseme's tarball script (tarme.rb).
   example: ./tarme.rb --version 2.9.90 --origin trunk amarok
 * Test the following:

     $ mkdir amarok-build-test && cd amarok-build-test
     $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kf5-config --prefix` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ../amarok-2.9.90
     $ make

 * mkdir ~/.kde-test && export KDEHOME=$HOME/.kde-test
 * Check it works OK without any amarok files in $KDEHOME (i.e. new user config)
 * Make a backup of $KDEHOME/share/apps/amarok and $KDEHOME/share/config/amarok*
   (release_scripts/backup_userdata.sh)
 * Check it works with an existing $KDEHOME, including database updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3: Once Happy with the Tarball

 * Maybe generate a html changelog file using releaseme's script (logme.rb).
 * Tag the commit using releaseme's tag script: "./tagme --version 2.9.90"
 * Follow the releaseme scripts' instructions for transferring the tarball to
   ftp://upload.kde.org/incoming and file a sysadmin request to have it
   transfered to stable/amarok/$version/ or unstable/amarok/$beta-version/
   Note that releaseme scripts provide a link to pre-filled template, which also
   includes a request to create a Bugzilla target for the new version.
   More instructions at ftp://upload.kde.org/README
 * Notify packagers:
To: kde-announce-apps@kde.org
"
Dear packagers

Here you can find the beta tarball for the upcoming $version release:
https://download.kde.org/download.php?url=unstable/amarok/$beta-version/src/amarok-$beta-version.tar.bz2

sha256sum: $(sha256sum tarball.tar.bz2)

We plan to release the final about 3 weeks from now but please make
this available to users via a specialized beta archive for packaging
if possible. We hope to get as much testers for this beta.

Thanks for packaging.
The Amarok Team
"

 * Write release notes and dot story (and notify KDE-press list if necessary)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4: The Release Day

 * Make tarball public
 * Use releaseme scripts similarly to beta release, also ask to disable unstable
   version bug reporting
 * Update download page on the wiki
 * Update the amarok.kde.org front-page
 * Send a witty, intelligent and diligently crafted email to the following lists:
     To:  kde-announce-apps@kde.org, amarok@kde.org
     BCC: kde-multimedia@kde.org, kde-distro-packagers@kde.org,
          (kde-press-announce@kde.org)
 * Update IRC channel topics
 * Update social networks
 * Write blog post
 * Publish dot story (for major versions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5: After the Release

 * Update shared/Version.h to 2.6-git (if the release was 2.6.0)
 * `git grep -ipn 'string freeze'` - now is the time to add/change strings

 If you must change anything about the tarball you shouldn't, but tag a new version.
 Previously this section stated that one should "email sysadmin@kde.org
 because otherwise they gets annoyed that the md5 has changed.
 Generally it is not wise to change the tarball, it could annoy the entire
 open-source world!" but this is probably not ok at all any more.

To create a changelog in html format for updating the various articles and websites, run
generate_changelog.rb.  It will output a file called ChangeLog.html.
